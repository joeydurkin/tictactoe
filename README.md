# tictactoe
This is an old tic tac toe school project dusted off for Java React practice.

INITIAL COMMIT 1/16/24
The old version is from my intro to computer science class that I took in Fall 2018. The final project
was to create whatever we liked, so I made a tic tac toe algorithm to play perfectly with the first turn.
This will always result in a CPU win (with imperfect player behavior) or a tie (with perfect player behavior).
It also prompts the player for trash talk, which just gets thrown back when the player loses.

This is a nifty piece of code, it functions as intended, and it got me the "A". However, it also reeks
of baby's first project and I'm going to fix that with two goals in mind: (1) The game logic is a sickening
cascade of if statements and I will change that. Really any improvement to style and simplicity
will make me happy. (2) I really abused System.out.println, this was before any of my experience with ui.
I will give this project a proper display, using this as an opportunity to learn React. (Hi PWW!)
